# Integrating React Native into an existing native codebase

These are slides from my talk at [React Native EU 2017](https://react-native.eu).

There is the original [Deckset markdown document](presentation.md) and thereâ€™s an [exported PDF](presentation.pdf), but the latter does not contain the speaker notes, for those you will have to read the former along side the PDF.
